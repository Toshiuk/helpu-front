The social isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly reduced our mobility, both physical and relational. The social layers most affected by the crisis are mainly the elderly and people with physical and chronic diseases. With this in mind, we aimed to develop a go-to application, which acts as a channel between the user and communication means, providing access to information and stimulating conversation in the virtual environment.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

We developed an application to establish a friendly channel, which acts as a bridge of dialogue between the target audience and volunteers, providing access to information, and stimulating healthy conversations in the virtual environment.
The platform is divided into two fronts - the solitary (user) and the solidary (volunteer). When registering, volunteers need to provide trivial identification and contact information, ensuring the safety and well-being of users on the platform.
For each new user, the application starts by presenting itself in a simple and unpretentious way - a one-button interface - which when pressed offers small gestures to help reducing loneliness, with the use of inspiring phrases, informative clippings, and videos about care mental health. After the user accesses these media, he can then proceed and ask for help from a support person. The volunteer will be able to collaborate by talking to this user or even helping him with daily tasks (e.g. medicare, grocery shopping, personal finance, etc.).
